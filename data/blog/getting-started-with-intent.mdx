In this blog, you will learn the core fundamentals of Intent. We will setup a new project, understand the directory structure and getting it running.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude={["Introduction"]} />

## Language
Intent uses `Typescript` as it's primary language.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that `Node.js` (version >= 18) is installed on your operating system.

## Setup
Setting up a new Intent project is quite easy with `npm` installed. You can run the following command in your terminal to get started.

It will ask you a few questions, you can choose `Yes` or `No` as per your requirement.
```bash live=true
$ npx new-intent-app@latest

? What's your *Intent* to name this project? new-sample-app
? Are you planning to use AWS in your application? Yes
? Would you like to use Redis in your application? Yes
âœ” Cloning repository
âœ” Installing dependencies
âœ” Setting up .env
âœ” Reset git history
```

Once this command has ran, move to the directory `new-sample-app` and open it inside your fav code editor.

You will see a directory structure similar to the one mentioned below.

You can read more about the directory structure [here](https://tryintent.com/docs/directory-structure).

## Configuring the Project

> [!NOTE]
> Intent comes with default configuration with aim to help developers quickly setup the project and start building.
> You are free to make the changes as per your requirement.

Now when you open the `.env` inside the project, you will see set of following variables.

```ts
DEFAULT_DB=sqlite
DEFAULT_CACHE=memory
DEFAULT_QUEUE=sync
DEFAULT_STORAGE=local
DEFAULT_MAILER=logger
```

Let's understand these variables one by one.

```ts
DEFAULT_DB=sqlite
```
Whenever you launch a new project with Intent, it comes with `SQLite` configured as it's database. This helps you quickly get started.

If you wish to change the database configuration, click [here](https://tryintent.com/docs/db-getting-started).

```ts
DEFAULT_CACHE=memory
```

`memory` cache is the local cache, so you can start using Cache in your database without breaking a sweat.

If you wish to configure a different cache for your project, read [more](https://tryintent.com/docs/cache).

```ts
DEFAULT_QUEUE=sync
```
`sync` drivers are just a blank drivers which enable you to use queues in your application quickly. Read more about queues.

```ts
DEFAULT_STORAGE=local
```
Intent comes enabled with `local` storage by default with the files stored inside `storage/uploads` directory. Read more about storages.

```ts
DEFAULT_MAILER=logger
```
`logger` is the default driver of our Mailer, you can change this as per your requirement, to do so [visit](https://tryintent.com/docs/mailers).

## Running it locally
To run the project locally in watch mode, you can simply run the following command in your terminal.

```ts
$ npm run start:dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001), and you should be greeted with a message.

Since, Intent comes with support for console commands as well, it will only be fair to have a look at that as well.

Headover to your terminal, and run the following command.

```bash
$ node intent greet

Horace Slughorn once said -
"It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love"
```
Voila ðŸŽ‰ we are done with the project setup.

## Formatting & Linting

Intent comes configured with `eslint` and `prettier` which you can use to lint and format your code respectively.

To do, you can make use of the following command.

```
$ npm run lint
$ npm run format
```

## Running in Production
Just like any typescript project, you will need to first build the Intent app, and then start the server.
To do so, you can make use of the following commands

```ts
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

## Support

Though I am currently using Intent in multiple products, it's still the first release, so honestly there will be a few hidden bugs.
If you run into any similar issues, you can either raise an issue [here](https://github.com/intentjs/core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=), or drop me an email at `hi@tryintent.com` for any support.
